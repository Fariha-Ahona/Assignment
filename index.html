   <h4>Here I'm discussing about Mahmoud Darwish</h4>
    <p><b>Mahmoud Darwish</b> (Arabic: مَحمُود دَرْوِيْش, romanized: Mahmûd Dervîş, 13 March 1941 – 9 August 2008) was a Palestinian poet and author who was regarded as Palestine's national poet.He won numerous awards for his works. Darwish used Palestine as a metaphor for the loss of Eden, birth and resurrection, and the anguish of dispossession and exile.He has been described as incarnating and reflecting the tradition of the political poet in <em>Islam</em>, the man of action whose action is poetry.He also served as an editor for several literary magazines in Palestine.</p><br><br>

    <pre><h3>A lover from Palestine</h3><h5>Mahmoud Darwish</h5>
Take me, wherever you are,
Take me, however you are.
To be restored to the warmth of face and body,
To the light of heart and eye,
To the salt of bread and song,
To the taste of earth and homeland.
Shelter me in the warmth of your gaze,
Take me, a panel of almond wood, in the cottage of sorrows,
Take me, a verse from the book of my tragedy,
Take me, a plaything or a stone from the house,
So that our next generation may recall
The path of return to our home.
